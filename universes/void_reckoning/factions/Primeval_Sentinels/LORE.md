# The Primeval Sentinels

## Origin
The **Primeval Sentinels** are the oldest surviving civilization in the galaxy. Once masters of the stars, their empire collapsed eons ago. Now, they are a dying race, protecting the "Maiden Worlds" and the Star-Lattice gates from the "younger races" (everyone else).

## Culture & Society
A mournful, artistic, and highly disciplined society. They view war as an art form, a tragedy that must be performed perfectly. They are obsession with Fate and Prophecy.

**Motto:** *"The Stars Remember."*

## Mechanics: Eternal & Star-Lattice
They are few, but elite and hard to kill.
- **Eternal Warriors**: Their souls are preserved in spirit stones. Fallen units often go dormant rather than dying, capable of being revived.
- **Star-Lattice Gates**: They maneuver across the galaxy instantly using ancient portals, striking where least expected.
- **Elite Focus**: They have the strongest individual units but the smallest numbers.

## Key Figures
- **Farseer Eldrad**: A powerful resonator who navigates the threads of fate to ensure his people's survival.
- **Avatar of Khaine**: A molten statue brought to life by the sacrifice of a leader, embodying their war god.

## Visual Style
- **Colors**: Bone White, Emerald Green, Soul-Blue.
- **Aesthetic**: High Elves in Space. Wraithbone structures, smooth organic curves (plant-like), and tall, elegant helmets.
