# The Nebula Drifters

## Origin
The **Nebula Drifters** are a loose confederation of outcasts, deserters, and anarchists who fled the tyranny of the core worlds. They live entirely on their starships, never touching planetary soil unless they are pillaging it.

## Culture & Society
Their society is based on **Freedom** and **Prestige**. A Captain's authority is absolute but ephemeral; if they stop bringing in loot, they are mutinied against. They dress flamboyantly, prize speed over armor, and value personal skill above all.

**Motto:** *"We sow the wind, and we reap the whirlwind."*

## Mechanics: Raiding & Speed
They do not hold territory; they strip-mine it.
- **Raider Economy**: They gain resources by fighting on enemy planets.
- **Hit and Run**: Their fleets are faster than any other faction's on the strategic map.
- **Glass Cannons**: Their ships are fragile but deal immense damage, relying on evasion rather than shields.

## Key Figures
- **The Pirate King**: A mysterious figure who calls the grand conclaves.
- **Baroness Vex**: A famous captain known for raiding the Aurelian Hegemony's treasury ships.

## Visual Style
- **Colors**: Midnight Blue, Neon Pink, Jet Black.
- **Aesthetic**: Cyberpunk pirates. Spiked hulls, solar sails, holographic flags, and erratic engine trails.
