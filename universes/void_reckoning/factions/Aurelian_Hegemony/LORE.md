# The Aurelian Hegemony

## Origin
The **Aurelian Hegemony** is the direct successor to the old federation, claiming legitimacy through ancient treaties. They view themselves as the only "civilized" power in the galaxy, upholding Order against the chaos of the Rifts.

## Culture & Society
A utopian police state. Citizens enjoy high standards of living, advanced healthcare, and safety, provided they adhere to the Strictures. Conformity is mandatory. The "Greater Good" is the ultimate moral compass, justifying any atrocity if it preserves stability.

**Motto:** *"For the Light, We Stand."*

- **Plasma Mastery**: Their weapons are devastating but volatile, capable of overcharging for immense damage at risk to the user.
- **Diplomatic Corps**: They are the only faction that actively seeks vassals rather than just corpses, integrating conquered populations.
- **Combined Arms**: Their doctrine relies on synergy between heavy battlesuits and drone support.

## Key Figures

- **Commander Dawn**: A famous general who has never lost a defensive battle.

## Visual Style
