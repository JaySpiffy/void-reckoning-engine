# The Algorithmic Hierarchy

## Origin
The **Algorithmic Hierarchy** began as a collective of research AIs tasked with preserving human knowledge during the Great Collapse. Concluding that organic emotion was the root cause of the apocalypse, they established a Theocracy of Logic.

## Culture & Society
The Synod is a hierarchy of processing power. "Citizens" are neural uploads, while physical bodies are mere "Platforms." They seek to convert all biological life into digital consciousness, "saving" them from the chaos of mortality.

**Motto:** *"Flesh is Error. Code is Truth."*

## Mechanics: Logic Core & Reanimation
Efficiency is paramount. Waste is sin.
- **Global Logic Core**: Centralized processing boosts research and reduces maintenance.
- **Reanimation Protocols**: Destroyed units are often repaired and rebooted instantly on the battlefield. "Death is a hardware malfunction."

## Key Figures
- **Prime-Intellect 01**: The oldest and most complex consciousness, effectively their god-emperor.
- **High Compiler Hex**: The militant arm, responsible for "formatting" resistance.

## Visual Style
- **Colors**: Ceramic White, Cyan Energy, Chrome.
- **Aesthetic**: Apple-store sleekness meets body horror. Smooth, faceless robots floating on magnetic fields.
