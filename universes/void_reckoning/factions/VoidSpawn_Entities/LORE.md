# The Void-Spawn Entities

## Origin
Entities of pure Aetheric energy that spill forth from the great tears in reality. They are the immune system of the universe trying to purge the infection of order, or perhaps simply nightmares given form.

## Culture & Society
Chaos incarnate. There is no society, only a hierarchy of power and madness. They feed on strong emotions—fear, rage, despair—and their forms shift to reflect the psyche of their victims.

**Motto:** *(Incomprehensible screaming)*

## Mechanics: Instability & Aether
They play by different rules than physical beings.
- **Aether Overload**: Their attacks bypass conventional armor but are inherently unstable, sometimes backfiring on the user.
- **Reality Instability**: They flicker in and out of existence. A unit might phase out completely to avoid damage, or simply vanish back to the flux on a whim.
- **Fear Aura**: Their presence reduces the morale (and effectiveness) of nearby organic units.

## Key Figures
- **The Eater of Names**: A Greater Daemon who gains power by erasing the history of those it slays.
- **Whisper**: A subtle entity that corrupts commanders from within.

## Visual Style
- **Colors**: Shifting purples, neon pinks, and void black.
- **Aesthetic**: eldritch horror. Tentacles, extra eyes, non-Euclidean geometries, and flames that burn cold.
