# The Scrap-Lord Marauders

## Origin
The **Scrap-Lord Marauders** (or "Da Raiders" in their guttural dialect) are a fungal-based species that thrives in the ruins of fallen civilizations. They view war as a sport and technology as something to be looted and strapped together with duct tape.

## Culture & Society
Might makes Right. The biggest Marauder leads until a bigger one thumps him. They are surprisingly cheerful, treating galactic conquest as a grand adventure or pub crawl. Their economy is based on "Teef" (teeth) and scrap.

**Motto:** *"FUROR!!!"*

## Mechanics: Salvage & Jury-Rigging
They are resourceful and chaotic.
- **Salvage**: After every battle, they loot blueprints and resources from the wreckage.
- **Jury-Rigging**: Their mechanics (Meks) can repair vehicles mid-battle using enemy parts.
- **The Furor!**: As they fight, they generate psychic momentum that increases their speed and aggression.

## Key Figures
- **Ghazghkull**: The Prophet of the Furor, a massive warboss clad in adamantium scrap.
- **Big Mek Buzzgob**: A genius inventor who once turned a moon into a bomb.

## Visual Style
- **Colors**: Rust Red, Checkerboard Black/White, Dirty Yellow.
- **Aesthetic**: Junkyard Mad Max. Spikes, exhaust pipes, mismatched armor plates, and weapons that look like they shouldn't work.
