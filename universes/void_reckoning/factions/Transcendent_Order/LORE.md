# The Transcendent Order

## Origin
The **Transcendent Order** believes humanity's physical form is a chrysalis. Through genetic engineering and resonant conditioning, they have shed their "meat" to become beings of pure energy and thought.

## Culture & Society
A monastic meritocracy governed by the "Communion," a shared psychic link connecting all members. Privacy is non-existent, but so is loneliness. They pity the "bound" (corporeal races) and seek to "liberate" them—forcibly if necessary.

**Motto:** *"Matter divides. Thought unifies."*

## Mechanics: Resonant Dominance
They fight with their minds.
- **Resonant Communion**: All units share a bond. As long as the Commander lives, morale is unbreakable.
- **Energy Beings**: High resistance to physical damage, but vulnerable to electromagnetic disruption.
- **Flux Mastery**: They can teleport across short distances, bypassing fortifications.

## Key Figures
- **The Prophetess**: A being of blinding light who speaks the will of the Communion.
- **Grand Magus Kael**: The architect of their "Great Ascension" ritual.

## Visual Style
- **Colors**: Radiant Gold, Pure White, Electric Blue.
- **Aesthetic**: Divine Sci-Fi. Glowing robes, floating monoliths, halos of energy, and weapons that fire concentrated willpower.
