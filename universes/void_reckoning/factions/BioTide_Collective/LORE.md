# The Bio-Tide Collective

## Origin
The **Bio-Tide Collective** is not a civilization but a biological imperative. Originating from the intergalactic void, they are a single consciousness divided across trillions of bodies. They arrived in the sector drawn by the psychic beacon of the Aether Rifts, viewing the warring factions not as enemies, but as raw **Biomass**.

## Culture & Society
There is no culture, only the **Hunger**. The Hive Mind directs all action. Individual bio-forms are purpose-grown tools, discarded or recycled when no longer needed. They evolve rapidly, adapting to enemy weaponry within days of first contact.

**Motto:** *(Chitinous clicking)* ("Consume. Adapt. Grow.")

## Mechanics: Biomass & Adaptation
The Swarm feeds on death to fuel life.
- **Biomass Recycling**: Killed units (friend or foe) are melted down into Biomass pools.
- **Rapid Growth**: Biomass can be spent to spawn units instantly or discount costs.
- **Adaptation**: They do not research technology; they evolve it.

## Key Figures
- **The Swarm Lord**: The apex combat organism, seemingly immortal as its consciousness simply moves to a new body upon death.
- **Genetic Matriarch**: The localized synapse node that coordinates the planetary invasion.

## Visual Style
- **Colors**: Bone White, Purple Carapace, Acid Green.
- **Aesthetic**: Insectoid horror. Organic ships, living weapons, fluid motion, and overwhelming numbers.
