# The Steel-Bound Syndicate

## Origin
The **Steel-Bound Syndicate** hails from the forge-worlds of the **Ferrum Sector**, a cluster of planets entirely subsumed by industry. Originally the primary armory for the old empire, they seceded during the Great Rift events, believing that flesh is weak and steel is eternal. They do not worship gods; they worship **Efficiency** and the **Grand Design**.

## Culture & Society
Steel-Bound Syndicate society is a rigid stratocracy where status is determined by one's contribution to the War Effort. Citizens are "Assets," soldiers are "Units," and leaders are "Overseers." Weakness is purged, and emotion is considered a waste of caloric energy. They are not mindless automata, but rather grim professionals who view war as a simple equation of attrition.

**Motto:** *"Iron Within, Ruin Without."* (or *"Efficiency is our Shield, Output is our Sword."*)

## Mechanics: Industrial Might
The Vanguard wins not by heroism, but by overwhelming logistics.
- **Cheap Production**: Their factories never sleep, producing tanks and shells at a fraction of the cost.
- **Attrition**: They are willing to sustain 90% casualties if it means securing a 1% strategic advantage.
- **Mechanized Infantry**: Their soldiers are heavily augmented, often blurring the line between man and machine.

## Key Figures
- **High Marshal Korth**: A brilliant strategist whose body is 80% cybernetic. He commands the grand offensives.
- **Logos Delta-9**: The supreme AI advisor (or perhaps ruler) that calculates the optimal path to victory.

## Visual Style
- **Colors**: Gunmetal Grey, Hazard Orange Stripes, Rust Red.
- **Aesthetic**: Dieselpunk meets brutalism. Heavy treads, smoke stacks, rivets, and bulky power armor.
