# The Templars of the Flux

## Motto
*"Steel obeys the Will. Flesh obeys the Steel."*

## Archetype
**The Crusader**: An aggressive, expansionist theocracy that views the Aether Rifts not as a disaster, but as a divine test. They believe humanity's survival depends on imposing order upon the chaos through sheer force of will.

## Origin Story
Before the Shattered Expanse, the Templars of the Flux were known as the **United Earth Peacekeeping Corps**. When the Aether Rifts opened and reality began to dissolve, communication with Earth was lost. Surrounded by madness and shifting physics, General **Marcus Valerius** rallied the remaining fleets. He declared that the only way to survive the "Great Unmaking" was to forge a reality of their own through collective belief.

Valerius penned the **"Codex Aeterna"**, a doctrine stating that objective reality had failed, and only "The Will" could hold the universe together. Over centuries, this military structure morphed into a rigid theocracy. They do not merely fight enemies; they fight to stabilize existence itself.

## Culture & Society
*   **The Conviction**: The central tenet of their society. Citizens are trained from birth to focus their minds to "hold reality still." A moment of doubt can literally cause a hull breach in deep Aether.
*   **Hierarchy**:
    *   **High Marshal**: The supreme military and spiritual leader.
    *   **Chaplains**: Battlefield commanders who channel the collective will of their squads to power weapons and shields.
    *   **Legionnaires**: The bulk of the populace, citizen-soldiers.
*   **Aesthetics**: Gothic industrialism. Ships are flying cathedrals, adorned with prayer strips and purity seals. Their armor is heavy, blocky, and inscribed with litanies.

## Key Characters
*   **High Marshal Kaelen the Unbroken**: The current leader. It is said he stared into a Rank 5 Flux Storm and *it blinked*. He leads from the front line aboard the flagship *Eternal Truth*.
*   **Confessor Vayla**: A powerful psychic null who hunts down "heretical" Aether-wielders. She captures Resonators to burn them as fuel for the Geller-Fields (Reality Anchors).

## Gameplay Style
*   **Strengths**: Extremely high Morale, heavy armor, strong melee/boarding capability.
*   **Weaknesses**: Slow strategic speed, low scientific research (they view unchecked science as dangerous).
*   **Signature Mechanic: Conviction**:
    *   Gains **Conviction Stacks** when killing enemies or winning battles.
    *   Stacks provide passive buffs to **Damage Resistance** and **Melee Damage**.
    *   At max stacks, they enter a **"Crusade"** state, gaining massive momentum.
