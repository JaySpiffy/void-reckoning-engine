# The Void Reckoning

## Overview
The Void Reckoning is a galaxy torn asunder by "Aether Rifts"—tears in reality where the laws of physics break down and subjective will overrides objective fact. There is no central government, only warring archetypes struggling for survival, dominance, or transcendence.

## Core Concepts
- **The Aether**: A dimension of pure energy and thought. It is the source of FTL travel ("Rift-Walking") and "Resonance" (magic/resonants).
- **Conviction**: The measure of a being's ability to impose their will on the Aether. High conviction shields against fluxing and powers weapons.
- **Resonance Nodes**: Strategic points in space where the Aether is stable enough to be harvested.

## Faction Intel
See [Faction Comparison](FACTION_COMPARISON.md) for a detailed breakdown of strengths, weaknesses, and matchups.

### 1. The Templars of the Flux (The Crusader Archetype)
*Motto: "Steel obeys the Will."*
A warrior culture that believes the Aether is a test of faith. They wield "Conviction Rifles" that fire projectiles sheathed in psychic energy. Their armor is inscribed with prayers that literally harden the metal against attacks.
**Mechanic**: *Conviction* - Gains power from zeal and righteous kills.

### 2. The Transcendent Order (The Resonator Archetype)
*Motto: "Flesh is a cage. The Aether is freedom."*
A monastic transhumanist society. They seek to shed their physical forms and become pure energy. They use "Aether Lances" and "Flux Skiffs" to manipulate the battlefield, turning their enemies' own aggression against them.
**Mechanic**: *Resonant Dominance* - Masters of morale and mental warfare.

### 3. The Steel-Bound Syndicate (The Industrial Archetype)
*Motto: "Reality is non-negotiable."*
Stubborn materialists who reject the Aether. They rely on "Null-Field Generators" and massive kinetic artillery to deny their enemies' magic. Their ships are flying fortresses of cold, hard steel.
**Mechanic**: *Industrial Might* - Overwhelming production and attrition.

### 4. The Bio-Tide Collective (The Biological Archetype)
*Motto: *Hunger.* *
An endless biological tide that consumes everything in its path. They adapt rapidly, incorporating the genetic strengths of their enemies.
**Mechanic**: *Biomass* - Feeds on death to fuel rapid growth.

### 5. The Algorithmic Hierarchy (The Machine Archetype)
*Motto: "Logic is absolute."*
A theocratic AI collective that worships the "Great Algorithm." They view organic life as inefficient and seek to "optimize" the galaxy through assimilation.
**Mechanic**: *Logic Core & Reanimation* - Undying mechanical legions.

### 6. The Nebula Drifters (The Outlaw Archetype)
*Motto: "We sow the wind."*
A loose confederation of pirates and anarchists who value freedom above all. They rely on speed and hit-and-run tactics to plunder resources from the slower superpowers.
**Mechanic**: *Raid Economy* - Gains wealth through aggression and speed.

### 7. The Aurelian Hegemony (The Order Archetype)
*Motto: "For the Light, We Stand."*
A utopian authoritarian state that seeks to unite the galaxy under a single, perfect order. They use advanced plasma technology and diplomacy to enforce their will.
**Mechanic**: *Plasma Mastery* - High risk, high reward energy weapons.

### 8. The Void-Spawn Entities (The Chaos Archetype)
*Motto: *(Incomprehensible screaming)* *
Nightmares given form. Entities of pure Aether that spill forth from the Rifts to spread madness and destruction. They defy the laws of physics.
**Mechanic**: *Aether Overload* - Reality-fluxing magic and instability.

### 9. The Scrap-Lord Marauders (The Horde Archetype)
*Motto: "FUROR!!!"*
Brutal, fun-loving marauders who build weapons from scrap. They literally believe their red vehicles go faster, and because of the Aether, they do.
**Mechanic**: *Furor!* - Momentum-based combat power.

### 10. The Primeval Sentinels (The Elder Archetype)
*Motto: "The Stars Remember."*
The dying remnants of the first galactic civilization. They protect the Star-Lattice gates and seek to prevent the younger races from destroying reality.
**Mechanic**: *Eternal* - Elite units that never truly die.
